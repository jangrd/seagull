replace all prints with SGL_Log
make work SGL_Log compile only in debug mode
make it print everything to a logfile
add colors to messages
better messages
make it keep output inside 80 columns

CODE FIX:
 !! - handle asserts with proper errors
	- make things that loop through elements use the windows index
	  so the tree is traversed only once
	- add success flag to SGL_VectorAdd because malloc can fail, but the return value is already used
	- remove 128 byte limit for SGL_Element.c -> fetchNextByDelim()
	- support case insensitive hex colors
	- rearrange structs so they take up less memory
	- use memory checker to find leaks (i think there are a few so far)

SECURITY FIX:
	- handle double free by calling dectructor twice (counter??? state checker???)
	  debug mode only???

FUTURE IDEAS:
	- generate uuid for every element so they can be removed by uuid for dynamic UIs
